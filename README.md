Manual api positive and negative test cases

ChatGPT
Sure! Here are some examples of positive and negative test cases for a manual API testing:

Positive Test Cases:

Verify that the API successfully returns the expected response when provided with valid input data.
Test the API with the maximum allowed input data to ensure it can handle large payloads without any issues.
Verify that the API handles concurrent requests gracefully and provides accurate responses.
Test the API with boundary values to ensure it handles edge cases correctly.
Validate that the API returns appropriate success codes (e.g., 200 OK) for successful requests.
Test the API with various valid input formats (e.g., JSON, XML) to ensure it can handle different data formats effectively.
Check that the API responds within an acceptable time limit for normal usage scenarios.
Verify that the API handles authentication and authorization correctly for authorized users.
Negative Test Cases:

Test the API with invalid or missing input data to ensure it returns the appropriate error messages or status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
Validate that the API rejects requests with unsupported HTTP methods (e.g., DELETE, PUT) if applicable.
Test the API with requests that exceed the maximum payload size, and verify that it handles them appropriately (e.g., returns a 413 Payload Too Large status code).
Verify that the API handles rate limiting or throttling correctly by sending a high volume of requests in a short period and checking for the expected responses.
Test the API with invalid authentication credentials to ensure it rejects unauthorized requests with the appropriate error codes (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).
Validate that the API handles server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) gracefully and provides informative error messages for troubleshooting.
Test the API with requests that contain malicious or malformed data to ensure it has adequate security measures in place (e.g., input validation, sanitization) and handles such cases appropriately.
Check that the API returns proper error responses for specific scenarios, such as requesting a resource that doesn't exist (e.g., 404 Not Found).
Remember that these test cases serve as examples, and the specific test cases you choose will depend on the requirements and functionality of your API.

Give me for Get method

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some examples of positive and negative test cases specifically for the GET method:

Positive Test Cases:

Send a GET request to retrieve a specific resource and verify that the response contains the expected data.
Test the API with different valid query parameters to ensure it filters or sorts the results correctly.
Verify that the API supports pagination correctly by sending multiple GET requests with different page numbers and checking that the results are consistent.
Test the API with a valid request for a resource that has a large amount of data to ensure it returns the data efficiently without any performance issues.
Check that the API handles caching properly by sending a GET request for the same resource multiple times and verifying that subsequent requests return a cached response with appropriate caching headers.
Test the API with concurrent GET requests to ensure it handles multiple requests simultaneously and provides accurate responses without any data inconsistency.
Validate that the API returns the appropriate status code (e.g., 200 OK) for successful GET requests.
Test the API with different acceptable media types (e.g., JSON, XML) in the "Accept" header and verify that the response format matches the specified media type.
Negative Test Cases:

Send a GET request for a resource that doesn't exist and verify that the API returns the appropriate status code (e.g., 404 Not Found) and error message.
Test the API with invalid or missing query parameters and verify that it handles them gracefully, returning appropriate error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
Verify that the API rejects unauthorized GET requests by sending a request without valid authentication credentials and checking that it returns the appropriate status code (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).
Test the API with requests that exceed the maximum allowed URL length and verify that it handles them correctly, returning a 414 URI Too Long status code if applicable.
Check that the API handles rate limiting or throttling correctly by sending a high volume of GET requests within a short period and verifying that it returns the expected responses, such as a 429 Too Many Requests status code.
Test the API with GET requests that contain malformed or invalid headers and verify that it rejects them with appropriate error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
Verify that the API returns proper error responses (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) for server-side issues, such as database connectivity problems or internal server errors.

import requests

# Positive Test Cases
# 1. Send a GET request to retrieve a specific resource and verify the response
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/resource/1")
assert response.status_code == 200
# Add assertions to validate the response data as per your specific requirements

# 2. Test the API with valid query parameters and verify the filtered/sorted results
params = {
    "filter": "category",
    "sort": "name"
}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/resources", params=params)
assert response.status_code == 200
# Add assertions to validate the filtered/sorted results as per your specific requirements

# 3. Verify that the API supports pagination correctly
page = 1
while True:
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/resources?page={page}")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    # Add assertions to validate the paginated results as per your specific requirements
    data = response.json()
    if not data["next_page"]:
        break
    page += 1

# 4. Test the API with a large resource and verify the response efficiency
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/large_resource")
assert response.status_code == 200
# Add assertions to validate the response data and performance as per your specific requirements

# Negative Test Cases
# 1. Send a GET request for a non-existent resource and verify the response
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/invalid_resource")
assert response.status_code == 404
# Add assertions to validate the error message as per your specific requirements

# 2. Test the API with invalid or missing query parameters
params = {
    "invalid_param": "value"
}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/resources", params=params)
assert response.status_code == 400
# Add assertions to validate the error message as per your specific requirements

# 3. Verify that the API rejects unauthorized GET requests
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/resources", headers={"Authorization": "invalid_token"})
assert response.status_code == 401
# Add assertions to validate the error message as per your specific requirements

# 4. Test the API with a request that exceeds the maximum URL length
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/" + "a" * 2048)
assert response.status_code == 414

# 5. Check that the API handles rate limiting or throttling correctly
for _ in range(100):
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/resources")
    if response.status_code != 200:
        break
assert response.status_code == 429
# Add assertions to validate the error message as per your specific requirements

# 6. Test the API with GET requests containing malformed headers
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/resources", headers={"Invalid-Header": "value"})
assert response.status_code == 400
# Add assertions to validate the error message as per your specific requirements

# 7. Verify that the API returns proper error responses for server-side issues
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/unavailable_resource")
assert response.status_code == 500
# Add assertions to validate the error message as per your specific requirements
